/* CSCI 261 Homework 05: High Low Number Guessing Game
 *
 * Author: Alex Patel
 *
 * This program plays the classic number guessing game High Low.
 * In addition to the basic game, it limits the number of guesses,
 * shows the expected range of guesses, validates each guess, and
 * displays a few different messages at the end of the game.
